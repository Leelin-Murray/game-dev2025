<p>
    I watched this video about EasyEda:  
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjPNYMRA0m8&list=PLbKMtVtYbdPMZfzGuvTdc0MWKrFvU4nsu&index=2" target="_blank">

<h2>Key Takeaways From the Tutorial</h2>
<p>
    The tutorial showed me <b>EasyEDA</b>, an online platform for creating and simulating electronic circuits.  
    During the video, I learned how to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Build a schematic diagram using various electronic parts.</li>
    <li>Link components together to form a complete circuit.</li>
    <li>Switch between schematic and PCB layout views.</li>
    <li>Design the printed circuit board (PCB) layout.</li>
    <li>Export and prepare the project for fabrication using JLCPCB.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    showed the process of transforming an electronic idea into a physical product—from concept → schematic → PCB → final prototype.
</p>

<h2>JLCPCB</h2>
<p>
    <b>JLCPCB</b> is a manufacturer of printed circuit boards and integrates directly with EasyEDA.  
    After finishing my design, I learned how quick and straightforward it is to place an online PCB order.  
    JLCPCB is well-known for producing high-quality boards, with affordable prices.

<h2>About EasyEDA</h2>
<p>
    <b>EasyEDA</b> is a browser-based circuit design software that combines multiple tools in one workspace.  
    It allows users to perform schematic capture, circuit simulation, PCB layout, and even ordering—all from one platform.  
    This makes it a great choice for both beginners and experienced electronics designers.

<h2>The RAKWIRELESS RAK3112 Module</h2>
<p>
     Mr. Ellis also spoke about the <b>RAKWIRELESS RAK3112</b> module.  
    This device supports <b>LoRaWAN</b> communication, making it ideal for <b>IoT (Internet of Things)</b> projects.  
    It provides long-range, low-power data transmission
