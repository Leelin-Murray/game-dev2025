<h1 align="center">Exploring EasyEDA Through YouTube</h1>

<p>
    To understand how to use EasyEDA, I watched this instructional video on YouTube:  
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjPNYMRA0m8&list=PLbKMtVtYbdPMZfzGuvTdc0MWKrFvU4nsu&index=2" target="_blank">
        EasyEDA Tutorial – YouTube
    </a>
</p>

<h2>Key Takeaways From the Tutorial</h2>
<p>
    The tutorial introduced me to <b>EasyEDA</b>, an online platform for creating and simulating electronic circuits.  
    During the video, I learned how to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Build a schematic diagram using various electronic parts.</li>
    <li>Link components together to form a complete circuit.</li>
    <li>Switch between schematic and PCB layout views.</li>
    <li>Design the printed circuit board (PCB) layout.</li>
    <li>Export and prepare the project for fabrication using JLCPCB.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    This video clearly showed the process of transforming an electronic idea into a physical product—from concept → schematic → PCB → final prototype.
</p>

<h2>About JLCPCB</h2>
<p>
    <b>JLCPCB</b> is a leading manufacturer of printed circuit boards and integrates directly with EasyEDA.  
    After finishing my design, I learned how quick and straightforward it is to place an online PCB order.  
    JLCPCB is well-known for producing high-quality boards at affordable prices.
</p>

<h2>About EasyEDA</h2>
<p>
    <b>EasyEDA</b> is a browser-based circuit design software that combines multiple tools in one workspace.  
    It allows users to perform schematic capture, circuit simulation, PCB layout, and even ordering—all from one platform.  
    This makes it a great choice for both beginners and experienced electronics designers.
</p>

<h2>The RAKWIRELESS RAK3112 Module</h2>
<p>
    In the tutorial, Mr. Ellis also discussed the <b>RAKWIRELESS RAK3112</b> module.  
    This device supports <b>LoRaWAN</b> communication, making it ideal for <b>IoT (Internet of Things)</b> projects.  
    It provides long-range, low-power data transmission suitable for applications such as smart agriculture, smart cities, and environmental sensing.
