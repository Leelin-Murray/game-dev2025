<p>
Everything we have done so far with JavaScript on web pages is called 
<b>frontend development</b>. Frontend code controls what users see and interact with.
</p>

<p>
<b>Backend development</b> works behind the scenes. It handles data storage, user accounts,
and servers. Backend coding is more powerful than frontend coding, but it is also more
difficult to learn.

<h3>Backends I Researched</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Supabase</li>
    <li>Render</li>
    <li>Firebase</li>
    <li>Netlify</li>
</ul>

<h3>Backends I Tried</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Supabase</li>
    <li>Render</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Supabase and Render are both free and powerful backend platforms. 
Supabase is mainly used for databases and user authentication, while 
Render is used for running backend servers and APIs.
</p>

<p>
Both platforms take more time to learn compared to frontend coding, but they are very
useful for larger projects. Overall, I found Supabase easier to understand than Render.
