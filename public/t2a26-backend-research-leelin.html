Everything we have done with JavaScript on web pages is called frontend coding.  
Backend coding works in the background and handles data and servers. It is more powerful
but harder to learn.

<b>Backends I researched:</b><br>
• Supabase<br>
• Render<br>
• Firebase<br>
• Netlify<br>

<br>

<b>Backends I tried:</b><br>
• Supabase<br>
• Render<br>

<br>

<b>Conclusion:</b><br>
Supabase and Render are both free and powerful backend platforms. Supabase is good for
databases and user login, and Render is good for running backend servers. They take more
time to learn, but they are useful for bigger projects. Supabase was easier to understand
than Render.
